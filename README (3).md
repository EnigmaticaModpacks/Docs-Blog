# Minecraft 1.19

Now that Minecraft 1.19 is out I thought I'd make an announcement regarding our plans for the future versions. The release of Minecraft 1.19 kinda caught me off guard to be honest, I didn't think it'd be ready so soon but here we are :sweat\_smile:

We will begin working on Enigmatica 9 for Minecraft 1.19 as soon as a handful of good mods are available.

When we begin on E9, we will sadly stop development on Enigmatica 8. It's likely that [the update we've been working on](<README (2).md>) will never be released, but we'll see.

Enigmatica 6 will remain supported of course, and will receive updates whenever needed.



Thanks for reading.
