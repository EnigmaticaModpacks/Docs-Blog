# Release of Enigmatica 9!

### Enigmatica 9 is now available, at long last :smile:&#x20;

We hope you'll check it out!

We're keeping the modpack slim(-ish) this time around, to give ourselves time to really work with the content mods we've chosen.

Work on Enigmatica 9: Expert has begun, but there's still a ton left to do.



In my [last blog post](<README (3).md>) I stated that E8 would go out of support as soon as E9 dropped, but I've since then reconsidered. E8 will receive at least one more update before we stop development on it.
